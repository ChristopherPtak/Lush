_A Lua-extensible command-line shell_

This is a POSIX-style (eventually should be POSIX-compatible) command-line
shell that allows the user to customize and extend it using the Lua scripting
language. This allows for cleaner configuration code and plugins, as well as
modifications to the syntax and semantics of the shell language itself.
